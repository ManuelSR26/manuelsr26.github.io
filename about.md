## Hi there! My name is Manuel. 
### Originally from Mexico: born in Oaxaca and raised in Puebla. I have lived in several cities around the world. Since 2014, I reside in the USA (first in the San Francisco Bay Area and then in Orange County, with a stop for a few months in San Antonio TX).

### I work as an Engineer in the Telecom Industry supporting projects for Mobile Operators in the LTE and 5G domains. Currently, I am enrolled in an MSc. in Data Analytcs, and passionate about Data, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence. You can read more about my qualifications [here](https://manuelsr26.github.io/cv).  

### I enjoy travelling, going to concerts, and lately I'm learning to play the guitar.
