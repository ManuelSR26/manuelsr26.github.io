## <center> <span style="color:blue"> Hi there! </span>  </center>


<p style="text-align: center;">
<span style="color:black">My name is Manuel, the Telecom Wizard. I'm originally from Mexico: born in Oaxaca and raised in Puebla.  I have been living in California since 2014 (first in the San Francisco Bay Area and then in Orange County, with a few months in San Antonio TX in between).</span>
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<span style="color:black">I work as an Engineer in the Telecom Industry supporting projects for Mobile Operators in the LTE and 5G wireless networks. </span>
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<span style="color:black">I enjoy travelling, going to concerts, hiking, and swimming. Lately, I'm learning to play the guitar. </span>
